        "For this updated version of the exercise, I decided to go on bandcamp, and scrape the different genre pages as I found out that they were very well-marked in HTML. I am also a big fan of making my friends playlists so I thought I could use web scraping to generate random and unique playlist. I chose 8 genres or tags and put them in a list. Then, I generated another list that contains a random mix of genres to ensure a unique playlist. I then used that list to customize the target url, based on what the genre is, the corresponding tag webpage is scraped, and then a random song and artist is scraped from that page and included in the playlist. Happy listening :-)!"

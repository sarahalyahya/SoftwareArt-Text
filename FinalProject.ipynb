        "#The Unsent Project | Sent(?) \n",
        "###Idea\n",
        "The idea from my final project was inspired from our assignment 2 and the artist talk with Lauren Lee Mccarthy. Throughout this course, I've been interested in exploring human emotions and interactions which is why I kept finding myself going back to the \"The Unsent Project\". With my final project, I wanted to experiment with moving things outside the computer screen, discomfort, and human conversations. So, I decided to train GPT-2 to generate texts like the ones on the Unsent Project and then create a simple conversation \"Toolbox\" which can allow me to pick random machine-generated responses to use in a conversation based on the sentiment of the received message. \n",
        "###Steps\n",
        "####Scraping\n",
        "For this part, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape through 10 thousand texts from The Unsent Project and followed steps similar to what I did in the previous assignment. I went through each text, used TextBlob to make sure it was in English and translate it if it isn't. Finally, I ran a sentiment analysis on it to avoid any texts with polarity = 0. The final output from this step is a text document that I used to train GPT-2. \n",
        "####GPT-2\n",
        "This time, I had much more tokens to train the GPT-2 which helped in getting results that sounded more realistic and coherent. However, I wanted to maintain some of the randomness as I thought it could result in interesting reactions from people. \n",
        "####Processing Outputs\n",
        "I put all the GPT-2 outputs into a string, split it into a list and cleaned it up using Python string operations. Then, I created two separate arrays of positive generated texts and negative generated text for later usage.\n",
        "###The Cards \n",
        "I printed out some texts to create prompt cards. Ideally, I wanted to throw these around campus, but given the current health guidelines, plus the fact that my phone number was on the cards, I chose to experiment with having friends give them to their friends and see what happens.\n",
        "On one side, the card had the unsent text, on the other it \"You Just Received this Text on your phone. How would you respond? Whatsapp your reply to:\"\n",
        "###The Conversations Toolbox\n",
        "From there on, it was a waiting game to see when someone will finally text me. For the conversations, I created a \"conversation toolbox,\" that takes the received text as input and asks if I have any prompt for the answer. If I don't have a prompt, it gives me a previously generated text based on the sentiment of the received text. However, if I add a prompt, it runs the GPT-2 again, uses the prompt as the prefix, and generates a new text.\n",
        "###Video\n",
        "I chose to present my work in video format. I felt like it was the closest in communicating the experience to the viewers, something like an experimental film. \n",
        "###Reflection\n",
        "The main tools I used from our course were:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   BeautifulSoup\n",
        "2.   GPT-2\n",
        "3.   TextBlob (For polarity and translation)\n",
        "\n",
        "I tried to put these tools together in a way that can help me create an impactful real-life experience for the user. They were generally simple algorithms, but most of the weight was placed on the output and the human interaction in this project. I was mainly working towards getting reactions from people and interacting with them in an unfamiliar way. This project revealed a lot about how people try to adapt to artifical intelligence, even when they find it confusing. In many cases, it felt like they overlooked all the GPT-2 glitched that I hoped would get me a confused reaction from them. \n",
        "I think this project can still grow a bit more. I would be interested to see actual strangers interacting with this human/bot mix that I created, and see what a refined more large-scale version would yield. "

        "\"Overall I’d say this was a fairly strange experience. Even form the first response I received, I was slightly confused. Because it said “-m” and then in brackets explained that (this was written before a breakup occurred as I was back to being my normal self,)” so I was just thinking: what? what is going on? What breakup? Also the “back to being my normal self” part I couldn’t understand. I didn’t say I was confused from the get go because I thought I’d get more clarification from the following messages but I just got more and more confused. Then there was the “From Wowpedia The Shining...” message which made me think that the respondent was sending me quotes from the book. I thought for a second that that could’ve been a character in the book. I speculated that I was just speaking to a bot at some points but I still tried to make sense of things somehow without trying to jump to that conclusion too quick. Then, by the end I was pretty confident that these were auto generated messages. So I just gave up with trying to give a solid response because none of the responses I was receiving made much sense.\"\n",
